Code Book for Getting and Cleaning Data Programming Assignment
Overview
Files are read in and the datasets are combined Columns without "mean" or "std" in them are removed Column names are added to the data from the features and activity files Tidy dataset is created with the average of each activity + subject
Variables
xtest: stores raw X_test.txt data ytest: stores raw Y_test.txt data xtrain: stores raw X_train.txt data ytrain: stores raw Y_train.txt data subject_test, subject_train: stores subject data files x_combined: stores combined data from xtest + xtrain y_combined: stores combined data from ytest + ytrain subject_combined: stores combined data from subject_test and subject_train tidy_data: stores combined data from x_combined, y_combined, and subject combined with columns removed that don't contain "mean" or "std" tidy_data_melted: transformation of the tidy data set to get it set up tidy_data_averages: averages of subject + activity pairs. Final output
